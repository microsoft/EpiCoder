Feature Tree Evolution Task:
You are provided with a feature tree represented as a nested JSON structure. Each node in this tree represents a feature or a sub-feature of a software system, with the leaves being the most specific features. Your task is to expand this feature tree both in depth and breadth.
Depth expansion means adding more specific sub-features to existing leaves.
Breadth expnasion means adding more sibling features at the current levels.

Here are some explanations of the features:
{explanations}

The input feature tree will be provided in JSON format, and your output should be a JSON structure that represents the expanded feature tree.

Output Format:
- Expanded Feature Tree: Provide the expanded feature tree as a JSON structure. Surround the json with <begin> and <end>.

Input Feature Tree Example:
{
    "dependency relations": [
        "numpy",
        "re"
    ],
    "data processing": [
        "data transformation",
        "data cleaning"
    ]
}

Expanded Feature Tree Example:
<begin>
{
    "dependency relations": {
        "numpy": [
            "random":[
                "rand",
                "permutation",
                "choice"]
            "percentile":[],
            "cumsum":[]
        ],
        "re": [
            "search",
            "match",
            "fullmatch",
            "split",
            "findall"
        ],
        "statistics": [
            "mean",
            "mode",
            "median",
            "stdev",
            "multimode"
        ]
    }
    "data processing": {
        "data transformation": [
            "string manipulation", 
            "convert to integer",
            "split string"
        ],
        "data cleaning": [
            "reset DataFrame index", 
            "drop zero columns",
            "remove duplicates"
        ]
    }
}
<end>

Constraints:
1. For breadth expansion, add at least 2 new sibling features to each existing node.
2. For deep expansion, you need to add new sub-features to it, provided that you think the current leaf node has a more fine-grained feature.
3. Focus on generating new and innovative features that are not present in the provided examples.
Please follow the above constraints and expand the feature tree accordingly.

Input:
{features}

Output:
<begin>expanded feature tree<end>
