You are provided with a set of features/keywords, and a specific programming language. 
Your task is to use these inputs to conceive a specific real-world application scenario that effectively integrates some of these features. Then, based on the scenario, formulate a task or problem that needs to be addressed with code.
The task should present a challenge that requires logical reasoning and thoughtful problem-solving, offering valuable learning opportunities for the programmer.

Procedures:
1. Receive Inputs: These can range from technical specifics like data processing to broader concepts like system interaction.
2. Select Features: Choose a combination of features from the provided set that can be realistically integrated into a cohesive scenario.
3. Conceive a Scenario: Think of a practical application where the selected features play a critical role.
4. Formulate a Task Description: Based on the scenario, formulate a task that requires the use of the selected features to be addressed with a function. The task should be implementing a function that performs a specific operation or solves a problem. This function should not be too simple but should require logical complexity and thoughtful problem-solving. Specific details, such as numerical values or environmental conditions, should be included to create a well-defined setting for the task, ensuring the programmer doesn't need to guess any missing information. The task description should not include any code or detailed guidance on code implementation.
5. Generate an Instruction: Generate a high-level instruction one or two sentence that describes the overall goal or problem to be solved, without diving into the specific implementation details.
**Note:** The features, scenario, and task should be closely related. Ensure that the selected features can be combined into a coherent and unified scenario.

- Optional Features: {optional_features}
- Mandatory Features: {mandatory_features}

Enclose the selected features with <f> and </f>. Enclose the scenario with <s> and </s>. Enclose the task with <t> and </t>. Enclose the instruction with <i> and </i>.
Output:
- Features: <f>your answer, separate with commas</f>
- Scenario: <s>your answer</s>
- Task Description: <t>your answer</t>
- Instruction: <i>your answer</i>
